# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.
# Feel free to amend for your own requirements.
# ---
# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'history' mode, which is best suited to
# making sure your site's appearance remains consistent over
# time.
#
# `wraith history history.yaml` # generate base screenshots
# `wraith latest history.yaml`  # take new shots and compare
# ---
# Installing:
#
# On a GOV.UK VM, run:
#   `apt-get install imagemagick phantomjs`
#
# Otherwise, on a Mac, run:
#   `brew install imagemagick phantomjs`
